spring frame work?
spring is developed by rodd john son in 2002
it is also called frame work of frame work
i.e, u can integrate spring with hibernate,struts, as well as JUNIT mocktile etc
spring is also used for dependency injection?



what is dependancy injection
part of the code is saperated from the program and kept in a saperate file is called dependancy.



saperated code is called dependancy.
eg;;
Suppose if u want to write a program to display the name age and city of a person 
if u write presentation logic, bisiness logic as well data access logic in one file
It is not a dependency injection
it is called "Tightly coupled code"

if u w
rite presentation logic, business logic as well data access logic in saperate file 
It is called a dependecy injection
it is called "Loosely coupled code"

Advantage of spring frame work
1.predefined template: Spring supports classes like jdbcTemplate to connect to the database
2.Dependency injection u can write a spring program in a such way that part of the dependecy is saperated from
program and kept in another file
3.loose coupling
4.easy to test
5.Interaction with different modules like jpa jta js jdbc mvc web rest etc
6.declarative approach
mean u can use xml file also to write the program if u use java approach to write the protam it is called
declarative approach
If u use java approach to write the program it is called programmatic approach(annotations)

Types containing in speing
Since spring uses dependency injection so first business logic is executed then the spring container creates the
object that is why spring is also called IOC container inversion of control container

2Types
1.Bean Factory used to initialize configure instantiate and assemble the bean
it is present in  org.springframework.beans.factory.*package

Syntax
Resource r=new ClassPathResource(String xml)
BeanFactory b=new XmlBeanFactory(r)
methods--
Object getBean(String s)
Object getBean(Class C)
Instatiates the Bean

Features--
doea not supports annotation
does not supports integration with 
ApplicationContext--
used to initialize cofigure institate and assemble


Types of dependency injection---
2Types-
setter injection-in this business logic for spring is executed by setter methods 
constructor injection-in this business logic for spring is executed by consturctors

steps to write 1 spring program
1.create a POJO class using setter/constructor injection
2.create xml FILE to achieve dependency injection for setter method we use <property> tag
3.write a main program where spring IOC container instatiates the bean


Spring 5.3 annotations
jsr annotations
@Autowired
@qualifier
@Bean
@Configuration
@Scope

Stereo type annotation
@Component
@Service
@Repository
@Controller



@Autowired annotation
it is method/field/constructor level annotation used to collaborate the beans
ele
Autowiring has 4 types
1.byName--- in this id of one bean must be same as property oof another bean
2.byType inthis one bean collaborates with another bean by their type by using setter injection
3.constructor same as by type but constructors are used

Note: in byType/constructor autowiring if more than 1 instance of same bean exists container returns error

to use annotatio import context name space in xml file an add <context:component-scan/> tag
u must use ApplicationContext IOC inversion of control container

class Department
{
	String name;
	String city;
}
Department dept;
}
Here Emp depends on Dept



using @Autowired achieve DI
